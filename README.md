Hi! I'm Julio Loayza, a Master's student in Cryptology and High-Performance
Computing at
[Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/),
in the
[SFPN](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/masters/master-informatique/parcours-sfpn)
course.

I enjoy coding. For my personal projects I mostly use Python as I like the
shorter idea-to-implementation time it allows. Most of the projects I've
done during my studies were written in C so I've become quite proficient in C.

I'm passionate about FOSS, free and open source software. That's why my projects
are released under permissive or copy-left licenses, and also the reason why
I've started using
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/)
instead of GitHub. While projects I've started on GitHub (like
[CroissantBot](https://github.com/JulioLoayzaM/CroissantBot))
will remain here for the time being, new projects will be on Codeberg:

I have a personal site:
[www.julioloayzam.com](https://www.julioloayzam.com).

Une version en français de mon site est disponible à l'adresse
[fr.julioloayzam.com](https://fr.julioloayzam.com).
