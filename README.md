Hi! I'm Julio Loayza, R&D engineer at Quarkslab. I've developed (and still work
on) [crypto-condor](https://github.com/quarkslab/crypto-condor), a Python
library and CLI to test implementations of cryptographic primitives.

Besides work, I like to code and write. I have a [personal
site](https://www.julioloayzam.com), which also documents [my
projects](https://www.julioloayzam.com/projects/), as not everything is on
GitHub. [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) seems like an alternative that actually
values free and open source software.
